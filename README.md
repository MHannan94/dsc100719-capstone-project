# Handwriting recognition in Bengali

### Author- Mohammed Hannan

## Project description

The <a href= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengali_alphabet>Bengali alphabet</a> consists of over 150 letters. A word is made up of characters, and characters are constructed from multiple letters. Specifically, a character contains a grapheme root, and can have two additional accents: vowel and consonant diacritics. The challenge is to create a machine learner that can identify the components in a single grapheme.

## Data
Collected by Bengali.AI, the data consists of over 200,000 images of handwritten graphemes collected from volunteers filling out surveys.
